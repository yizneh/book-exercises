# Exercise 5: dplyr grouped operations

# Install the `"nycflights13"` package. Load (`library()`) the package.
# You'll also need to load `dplyr`
install.packages("nycflights13")
# should be done already
library("nycflights13")
library("dplyr")

# What was the average departure delay in each month?
# Save this as a data frame `dep_delay_by_month`
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarizing your data
flights %>%
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(
    avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay,na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(avg_dep_delay == max(avg_dep_delay,na.rm = TRUE))


View(flights)

# Which month had the greatest average departure delay?
filter(avg_dep_delay == max(dep_delay))

# If your above data frame contains just two columns (e.g., "month", and "delay"
# in that order), you can create a scatterplot by passing that data frame to the
# `plot()` function
plot(dep_delay_by_month)

# To which destinations were the average arrival delays the highest?
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarize your data
# You can use the `head()` function to view just the first few rows

flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarize(
    avg_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay,na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(avg_arr_delay == max(avg_arr_delay,na.rm = TRUE))

# You can look up these airports in the `airports` data frame!
View(airports)
airports %>% 
  filter(faa=="CAE")

# Which city was flown to with the highest average speed?
flights %>%

  summarise(
