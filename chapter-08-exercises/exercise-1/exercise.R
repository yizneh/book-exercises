# Exercise 1: creating and accessing lists

# Create a vector `my_breakfast` of everything you ate for breakfast
my_breakfast<-list("milk","bread")

# Create a vector `my_lunch` of everything you ate (or will eat) for lunch
my_lunch <-list("fries","chicken tenders")

# Create a list `meals` that has contains your breakfast and lunch
meal<-list(breakfast=my_breakfast,lunch=my_lunch)


# Add a "dinner" element to your `meals` list that has what you plan to eat 
# for dinner
meal$dinner <-c("ramen","egg")
print(dinner)

# Use dollar notation to extract your `dinner` element from your list
# and save it in a vector called 'dinner'
dinner<-meal$dinner
print(dinner)

# Use double-bracket notation to extract your `lunch` element from your list
# and save it in your list as the element at index 5 (no reason beyond practice)
meal[[5]]<-meal[["lunch"]]
print(meal)
# Use single-bracket notation to extract your breakfast and lunch from your list
# and save them to a list called `early_meals`
early_meals <-meal[c("breakfas","lunch")]



### Challenge ###

# Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
# Hint: use the `lappy()` function to apply the `length()` function to each item
length(meal$breakfast)
lapply(meal,length)
# Write a function `add_pizza` that adds pizza to a given meal vector, and
# returns the pizza-fied vector
add_pizza<-function(meal_vector){
  new_vector<-c(meal_vector,"pizza")
  return(new_vector)
}
add_pizza(c("nachos"))

# Create a vector `better_meals` that is all your meals, but with pizza!
lapply(meal,add_pizza)
